### External Library
  
  - [x] Realm: Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
  
        - Realm’s object-oriented data model is simple to learn, doesn’t need an ORM, and lets you write less code.
        - Realm’s local database persists data on-disk, so apps work as well offline as they do online.
        - Realm is fully-featured, lightweight, and efficiently uses memory, disk space, and battery life.
